Code and notes from Summer 2012 adventures in programming and statistics with Jennifer.

We're using this for our own record-keeping purposes, so the notes and code will be understandable to us -- but maybe not understandable or useful to other people. That's okay. If you have questions, feel free to ask, but keep in mind that this is a summer project we're doing for fun, so you may or may not get a response. (You might. I generally try to reply. But I want to make sure I'm setting reasonable expectations here and not making any promises I can't keep.)
